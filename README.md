### Identifying traffic signs from an image

[This notebook](./Traffic_Signs_Recognition.ipynb) presents an approach for designing, training and evaluating a convolutional neural network for classifying traffic sign images using TensorFlow. 

This is my submission for projet 2 of Udacity's self-driving car engineer nanodegree program.
